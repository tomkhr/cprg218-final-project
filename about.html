                <p>This game was developed as part of a final project for Intermediate Web Communications class in the Interactive Design program at SAIT. The project required building a 3 page website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ensuring that there is a purposeful function for the use of JavaScript. The JavaScript written for this project includes objects and methods that were not taught this semester. This project was rather a tool to learn, research, test, and implement the possibilities of JavaScript leveraging the use of some online learning tools and developer communities such as W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow.</p>

                <p>Tap Crazy! is a fun inspired by one of the very first mobile games I downloaded on my iPod Touch back in 2010. Even though the idea of the game is quite silly, it is a blend of simplicity, fun, and drive. This game serves a purpose, and is a way train your tapping/pressing speed so you can implement this skills next time you are pressing the crosswalk button at an intersection, or call car button at an elevator. The faster you can tap, the faster the light will change and the faster the elevator will come. Just kidding, it ain't gonna help. </p>

                <p>My name is Tom Khrustalev, and I am a student at SAIT in the Interactive Design program, majoring in Web Design and Development. I come from a primary passion for design, but have a new found curiousity and interest for the web. This project has been a great learning curve for me, and I am eager to see what the rest of my IDWD program will teach me, so I can create some cool stuff that doesn't only look good, but also works!</p>
